- Upstream reconciliation: fetched `origin/xpbdRT`; no production-code delta, but its docs deletion overlaps the protected modified manifest. Local HEAD retained without altering user work.

## Resume protocol

Read all three planning files, then `git status --short`, `git log -10 --oneline`, `git diff`, `git diff --cached`, and the newest recorded test result. Resume the first non-complete phase; never infer repository state from chat history.
